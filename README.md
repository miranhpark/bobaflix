## `README` üìñ
- Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en); please make sure `npm` is installed and available
- `bobaflix` uses data from the [Yelp API](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/reference/v3_business_search) to find boba shops!
  - Parameters:
    - Within 6 miles (~10,000 meters)
    - Near any of the following 3 Netflix offices (choose one):
        - 121 Albright Way, Los Gatos, CA 95032
        - 888 Broadway, New York, NY 10003
        - 5808 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90028
- Using the column headers, you should be able to sort by both rating and distance
  - Hover near the column name and click on the arrow that appears to reverse the sort
  - Or, alternatively, click on the kebab menu on the right of the column name for more  options
- Use the page navigation at the bottom to load more results (up to 50)

## Usage üñ•Ô∏è
- To start both the server and client, please set the Yelp token as an environmental variable at the command-line:
  - e.g. `export YELP_API_TOKEN=<my-secret-token>`
- Then, please run `npm start` from the root directory
  - e.g. `npm start`
- If the browser doesn't automatically open, please go to `http://localhost:3000` to use the app

## Some process thoughts üß†
- The backend uses the Express.js, a relatively common HTTP framework
- The frontend uses [Material UI](https://mui.com/) (Mui) for component formatting and organization
- Right now, every time we switch a location selection there's a Yelp API call
  - If we needed to serve more traffic, it would be great if these results could be cached and/or stored (though the Yelp API TOS has some rules about it!), given you can only make 500 calls a day 
- I _definitely_ focused on having a frontend here, and didn't get around to tests, so please consider this `dev` and not production!
  - Next steps would definitely be adding at a minimum, something like some `jest` React component-rendering, and basic http/API/unit tests for internals
  
## `TODO`s/`FIXME`s/nice-to-haves üõ†Ô∏è
- I tried to do most of this in Typescript, but definitely had to leave some `any`s around
- The app assumes the API key is valid, but I would have loved to have some checking/validation/error handling around that
- The Yelp API has an in-beta GraphQL endpoint which might have been nice here if it works, given we used so few fields
- I didn't do a great job of distinguishing between `dev` (think: `npm -D install dev deps`) and production required dependencies for now (nor for `npm` scripts)
- CORS is enabled freely here since we're operating locally client-to-server
- Unfortunately, I ran out of time to make sure all the components were accessible/properly aria-label-ed, but would love to
- Pretty minor, but I would have also loved to add some better styling (and put it into individual style-sheets for components)
